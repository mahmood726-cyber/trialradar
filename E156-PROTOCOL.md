## `[158]` TrialRadar: Living Clinical Trial Surveillance Dashboard for Ghost Protocol Detection

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Ghost protocol detection rate  
**Data:** ClinicalTrials.gov API v2, 15 therapeutic areas

### 156-word body

Can a browser-based surveillance dashboard detect unreported clinical trials across multiple therapeutic areas using only open ClinicalTrials.gov registry data? TrialRadar is a single-file HTML application monitoring fifteen cardiovascular and metabolic therapeutic areas including colchicine, finerenone, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, PCSK9 inhibitors, and direct oral anticoagulants in real time. The system queries the ClinicalTrials.gov API to build a searchable registry then applies severity-ranked ghost protocol detection by identifying completed trials without posted results and flagging publication lags exceeding twelve or twenty-four months. Across initial scans of fifteen areas, approximately 40 percent of completed cardiovascular trials exceeded the twelve-month reporting deadline mandated by FDAAA 801 legislation. Enrollment-weighted severity ranking confirmed consistent ghost protocol rates across drug classes while highlighting the highest-impact unreported evidence gaps. Real-time registry surveillance systematically quantifies reporting transparency gaps without requiring institutional database access or specialized infrastructure. The limitation of API-only detection is that results posted outside ClinicalTrials.gov are missed, potentially overstating non-reporting rates.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
